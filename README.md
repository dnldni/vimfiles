# vimfiles

## Basic Overview 
My personal neovim init files using vim-plug plugin manager.

## Installation
Either use `git clone... ` or copy files to your neovom init folder.
See `:help vimrc` for where to put them.

## Dependencies
* Silver searcher
* Ripgrep

## Known issues.
Auto installation of vim-plug does not work on linux probably since i have not 
tested it there yet.
